/// Works around a LuaJIT fault in Ashita 4.3 as it runs on this Mac.
///
/// Under Wine/Rosetta, Ashita 4.3's Addons.dll intermittently dies with
/// EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION at Addons.dll+0xA0761A the first time a hot addon draws or handles a
/// command. That address disassembles to LuaJIT's `lj_mcode_patch` walking a NULL machine-code
/// area chain — the JIT's trace patcher, not the addon's own logic. Ashita's reaction is to unload
/// the addon, and sometimes every addon along with the Addons plugin. Two unrelated addons
/// (FFXIFriendList, GMTools) reproduced it identically; both were cured by `jit.off()` at the top
/// of their entry file, so that is what this applies, to every installed addon, before launch.
///
/// The change is one guarded line under a marker comment. It is idempotent (the marker is the
/// check), skips files that already call `jit.off()` themselves, and leaves anything it cannot
/// read as UTF-8 alone rather than risk mangling it. Removing the marker line opts an addon out.
///
/// See docs/FRIENDLIST.md ("Ashita 4.3 LuaJIT fault") for the disassembly and the evidence.

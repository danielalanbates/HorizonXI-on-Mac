/// Which server's branding the client shows on its title screen.
///
/// The client Daniel plays on was installed by HorizonXI, and their installer bakes their logo
/// into the game's own data -- entry `menu/titlwin` in `ROM/119/50.dat`. So when he connects to
/// his own LandSandBoat world, or to any other private server, the title screen still says
/// HORIZON XI. It should say what stock FFXI says.
///
/// The fix is an XIPivot overlay (`stockbrand`) holding one patched copy of that DAT with the
/// logo region replaced by the client's own untouched `menu/xilogo` artwork. XIPivot side-loads
/// it, so nothing under `SquareEnix/` is ever modified and the change is undone by dropping one
/// line from `pivot.ini`. `scripts/brandpatch.py` builds the overlay; `docs/BRANDING.md` explains
/// how the texture was found and what else was tried.
///
/// Two things this deliberately does not do:
///
///  * It does not touch the top ~296 rows of that texture, which are not branding at all -- they
///    hold the shared menu wordlist (OK, はい, いいえ, キャンセル ...) and the copyright line.
///  * It does not apply on HorizonXI. Playing on their server showing their branding is correct.

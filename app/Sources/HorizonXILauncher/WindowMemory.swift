/// resize: dragging the frame bigger just stretches (or letterboxes) that fixed back buffer, which
/// is why an enlarged window looks soft and "not filled". The only way to actually render at the
/// new size is to start the client at it. So while the client runs, its window is sampled; when
/// it exits, the last size is written into the world's boot profile (and the world's stored
/// graphics settings, so the panel agrees), and the next Play opens at the size the user chose.
///
/// Per world, because the profiles are per world: a maximised local-test window must not change

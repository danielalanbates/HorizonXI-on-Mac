# Wine 10.0 (Sikarugir), HorizonXI client 1.9.0, Ashita 4.3.1.2 — the first time FFXI has
# rendered natively on macOS. Every step here is load-bearing; see docs/FINDINGS.md for the
# instrumented evidence behind each one.

#
# The wrapper's wine/wineserver are linked with rpath @loader_path/../../, which resolves to
# SharedSupport/, but the dylibs ship in Contents/Frameworks/. Everyone works around this by
# exporting DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH — do not. SIP strips DYLD_* when exec'ing a protected
# binary, which includes nohup and /bin/sh, so anything scripted or backgrounded breaks with an
# unexplained "dyld: Library not loaded". Symlinking removes the env dependency entirely.

#
# Taken verbatim from HorizonXI's own Switch_Horizon.bat, which ships in SquareEnix/. The layout
# is not what it looks like:
#   InstallFolder\0001 = the FINAL FANTASY XI directory   (NOT PlayOnlineViewer)
#   InstallFolder\1000 = the PlayOnlineViewer directory
#   Interface\0001     = the string "0"
# Putting PlayOnlineViewer in 0001 — the intuitive reading — stops FFXiMain.dll loading at all.
#
# Write BOTH registry views. The 32-bit game reads HKLM\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\..., and the 64-bit
# reg.exe writes only the 64-bit view, so a prefix configured with plain `wine reg add` leaves the
# game seeing nothing.

#
# FFXI is three in-proc COM servers, not one: FFXi.FFXiEntry (FFXi.dll),
# FFXiMain.GameMain (FFXiMain.dll) and POLCore.POLCoreCom (polcore.dll). Missing any of them
# gives "Failed to initialize instance of FFxi!" or a bare err:ole:com_get_class_object.
#
# The /s flag is mandatory: without it FFXi.dll's DllRegisterServer opens a GUI dialog, and
# synthetic input (CGEvent) does not reach wine-hosted windows on macOS, so it hangs forever
# with nothing to click.

# 3b. Metal renderer (the performance fix).
#
# EXPERIMENTAL, OFF BY DEFAULT -- set HXI_METAL=1 to try it.
#
# Wine's builtin D3D8 runs through OpenGL and is translated on a single CPU thread: measured at
# 148% CPU with the GPU at 6%. Routing D3D8 -> d3d8to9 -> DXVK 1.10.3 -> MoltenVK -> Metal gets
# the CPU down to ~11-16% with the GPU at 24-32% -- but the window stays BLACK. DXVK creates the
# device, the GPU does work, and no frame is ever presented (watched for 6 minutes; the OpenGL
# path draws its splash in ~40s). So the low CPU partly reflects it not drawing. Presentation is
# the unsolved part; do not mistake the counters for a working renderer.
#
# Three things all have to be true or it silently fails:
#
#   1. api-ms-win-crt-*. This wine build ships NONE, and every renderer DLL imports a dozen of
#      them, so none of them can load in a stock prefix. The wrapper's own wine.cx32bak has
#      working 32-bit copies.
#   2. Ashita.dll imports d3d8.dll itself, so the shim must also sit where Ashita can see it --
#      C:\HorizonXI and bootloader\ -- not only in the game directories. Miss this and you get
#      "[E] Injection failed!", which looks like the renderer breaking Ashita and is not.
#   3. MoltenVK. The default libMoltenVK in the wrapper reports Vulkan 1.1 and DXVK cannot create
#      a device on it ("DxvkAdapter: Failed to create device"). The moltenvkcx build alongside it
#      reports Vulkan 1.2 and works. DXVK 2.x/3.x cannot be used at all -- they require Vulkan 1.3
#      and geometryShader, which Metal has no equivalent for.

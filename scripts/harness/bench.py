"""HorizonXI-on-Mac benchmark runner.

One command per configuration variant. Applies the variant, launches the game, walks it to the
character-select screen, samples the frame rate, screenshots the window in the background and
kills the client. Every variant is measured the same way so the numbers compare.

    ./bench.py --tag baseline
    ./bench.py --tag no-argbuf --env MVK_CONFIG_USE_METAL_ARGUMENT_BUFFERS=0
    ./bench.py --tag dxmt --profile profiles/dxmt.json

Frame rate comes from DXVK_FPS_LOG (built into our d3d9.dll) when the pathway uses DXVK, and
otherwise from fpsvideo.py, which counts visually distinct frames in a screen recording.

Scene: character select. Heavy (~1900 draws), deterministic, needs two keypresses to reach and
no character is in the world, so killing the client afterwards is safe.

# "Install FFXI on Mac.command" — double-clickable installer.
#
# Written for someone who has never opened Terminal. It explains what it is doing, checks the
# things that actually go wrong on this setup, and refuses to guess when it needs a human answer.
#
# It does NOT download the game. The client is ~27GB of Square Enix data and the Wine wrapper has
# licence questions this project has not cleared, so both are things you supply.

  You need two things this installer cannot legally fetch for you:

    1. The HorizonXI client (~27GB). Install it with HorizonXI's own Windows
       launcher, or copy an existing install, into:
           <wrapper>.app/Contents/SharedSupport/prefix10/drive_c/HorizonXI
    2. A Wine wrapper app (Kegworks / Sikarugir style) containing
           Contents/SharedSupport/wine/bin/wine

  Put the wrapper in /Applications or on an external drive, then run this again.

  One warning that will save you a day: the wrapper cannot live on an exFAT
  volume, and if it is on an external drive every app touching it needs the
  "Removable Volumes" permission in System Settings › Privacy & Security.

  Open HorizonXI-on-Mac from /Applications, pick your server, type your account
  name and password, and press PLAY. Your password goes into the macOS Keychain.

  Two things to expect:

    * macOS will ask for permission to read a removable volume the first time.
      Say Allow, or the launcher cannot see the game.
    * It is slow. Zone loads take minutes on an 8GB M1. That is a known,
      unsolved problem — see docs/ANNOUNCEMENT.md.

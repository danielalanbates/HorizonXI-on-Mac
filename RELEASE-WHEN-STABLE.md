# Standing instruction: ship an official release once the client is definitively stable

**From Daniel, 2026-08-17. This is a standing directive, not a one-off task.**

Whenever the HorizonXI-on-Mac client reaches a state that is *definitively stable*,
roll out an official release. Do not wait to be asked again — the ask has already been
made, permanently, right here.

## What "definitively stable" means
Not "it launched once." All of these, verified, not assumed:

- Client boots to the world reliably across several consecutive cold launches (no
  crash before addons load, no silent exit).
- Mouse works: cursor visible in-window, and addon/ImGui windows can be hovered and
  clicked. See `docs/MOUSE.md` — the click path still has an open rough edge
  (`io.MousePos` reading ImGui's -FLT_MAX sentinel) that must be closed first.
- No Wine window can end up unclosable (the `winedbg --auto` reaper is in the launch
  path; `scripts/quit-wine.sh` works).
- Frame rate holds at the project's max-settings target — never benchmark or ship with
  reduced effects, use `scripts/max.json` / `max4k.json`.
- A normal play session survives without needing manual intervention.

## What rolling out a release means
1. Confirm `/Applications/FFXI-on-Mac.app` is the single current build and is playable.
2. Archive every prior version/build out of the active tree first — keep exactly one
   current version live.
3. Fold the working fixes out of the diagnostic addon into their own proper addon.
   Right now the cursor fix and the shell->game command channel both live inside
   `mousediag`, which is a debug tool, not a shipping component.
4. Tag and cut a GitHub release with real notes covering what changed and what is
   still known-broken. Stability gates the release; a clock only caps it (Daniel,
   2026-08-22): the published .app is NOT re-cut for every fix — at most about once
   a week, and only once the build has been judged stable. Every criterion above
   verified fresh, plus several real play sessions on the current build without a
   single manual intervention. If a week passes and the tree is not stable, no
   release goes out — the cadence is a ceiling, never an obligation.
5. Say plainly in the notes what was verified and what wasn't. No "works" claims that
   were not actually tested.

## The local .app is a different thing from the release
`/Applications/FFXI-on-Mac.app` must stay playable at ALL times — Daniel plays on it
during development. It tracks the working tree: rebuild and reinstall it (`app/bundle.sh`,
then copy into `/Applications`) as soon as a fix lands, so his session is never stuck on a
stale build. Never replace the bundle while the launcher or a client is running; check
with `pgrep -fl "FFXI-on-Mac|horizon-loader|wine"` first and wait for an idle moment.

The GitHub release is the opposite: slow, gated, at most weekly. Fast local .app,
rare public release.

## Why this note exists
This project has repeatedly reached a good state mid-session and then lost it to the
next round of experiments. Cutting a release at the stable point is what makes the
good state recoverable.

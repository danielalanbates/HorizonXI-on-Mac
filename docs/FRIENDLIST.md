# Friend list without PlayOnline

The retail FFXI friend list is a PlayOnline Viewer feature. The client still ships the
commands — `/befriend`, `/friendlist`, `/flist`, `/blacklist`, `/blist`, `/search`,
`/sea` are all present as literal strings in `FFXiMain.dll` (around offsets 183088 and
184480) — but on a private server the PlayOnline half of that conversation does not
exist, so the feature is dead.

`addons/friendlist/friendlist.lua` reimplements it entirely client-side. **No server
changes and no private server are involved.** LandSandBoat is used here only as a local
*test bed*, never as part of the implementation.

## How it works

1. **Commands.** Ashita intercepts `/befriend` and `/friendlist` / `/flist` before they
   reach the server and blocks them. The names are identical to the originals, taken
   from the client binary, so people use the commands they already know.
2. **The handshake.** Friend requests ride on ordinary `/tell`, tagged
   (`<FLREQ>`, `<FLACK>`, `<FLNAK>`, `<FLDEL>`) with the marker stripped from the chat
   log before you see it. This preserves the mutual-consent flow of the original: you
   ask, they accept.
3. **Presence.** A tagged `<FLPING>` tell, answered by `<FLPONG>`.

The list is a plain text file per character under `addons/friendlist/data/`.

## Presence: why not /sea

`/sea` was the obvious idea and it is **wrong**. Search results travel on a separate
encrypted binary connection to the search server (`src/search/` in LandSandBoat —
blowfish + md5, `SearchPacket`) and are rendered into the client's own Search panel.
**They never appear as chat text**, so there is nothing for an addon to parse. An
earlier version of this addon scraped chat for `/sea` output; that could never have
worked.

What *does* produce chat text is a failed tell. The server answers a tell aimed at an
absent player with standard message **125** — "Your tell was not received. The recipient
is currently away." (`src/map/enums/msg_std.h:58`, sent from
`src/world/ipc_server.cpp:438`).

So presence is: ping a friend with a tagged tell and watch for that reply. The reply
means offline; no reply means the tell was delivered, which means online. A friend who
also runs the addon answers with `<FLPONG>`, which marks them online immediately.

**Caveat:** a friend *not* running this addon will see the raw tag text arrive as a
tell. Hence the deliberately slow poll (one query per 3s, full sweep every 60s).

## Commands

    /befriend <name>            Send a friend request.
    /friendlist                 Toggle the friend list window.
    /flist                      Same.
    /friendlist add <name>      Send a friend request.
    /friendlist delete <name>   Remove a friend.  (del / remove also accepted)
    /friendlist accept <name>   Accept a pending request.
    /friendlist decline <name>  Decline a pending request.
    /friendlist refresh         Poll presence now.
    /friendlist selftest        Run the built-in end-to-end test.
    /friendlist simulate <name> <REQ|ACK|NAK|DEL|PING|PONG>

## Verification status

**Verified live in the running client, 2026-08-17** — both against HorizonXI and against
the local LandSandBoat server. Screenshots: `friendlist-in-game.png`,
`friendlist-after-add-remove.png`.

- Addon loads clean and creates its per-character data file.
- `/friendlist selftest` — **11/11 PASS** inside the running game: inbound request
  creates a pending entry; accept promotes pending to friend; friend written to disk;
  friend survives reload from disk; delete removes the friend; removal persisted;
  remote delete drops the friend; decline clears the pending request; pong marks a
  friend online; an offline reply is attributed to the pinged friend; offline reply
  marks the friend offline.
- `/befriend Kiyoko` through the real command path produced
  "A friend request has been sent to Kiyoko."
- The Friend List window renders in game with friends, online markers, and a pending
  request with Accept / Decline buttons.
- `/friendlist accept` and `/friendlist delete` both changed the window and the on-disk
  file as expected.

**Verified live IN WORLD against the local LandSandBoat server** (character `Test`,
Southern San d'Oria) — screenshots `friendlist-in-world.png`,
`friendlist-live-presence.png`:

- A tagged tell round-trips through a real server: `>>Test : <FLPING>` went out and
  `Test>> <FLPING>` came back in. The handshake transport works for real, not just in
  the state machine.
- **Offline detection**: pinging an absent player produced the real server reply
  "Your tell was not received. The recipient is either offline or changing areas."
  and the friend was marked offline.
- **Online detection**: a delivered ping (no error reply) marked the friend online.
- The window showed "2 friends, 1 online" with correct per-friend markers.

Note the live wording is "either offline or changing areas", NOT the "currently away"
in the LandSandBoat source comment. The parser matches on `tell was not received`, which
covers both — but do not tighten it to the source-comment wording.

### Bug found by live testing

The first in-world run revealed that both directions of a tell carry the tag and the
original regex matched both:

    outgoing echo :  ">>Name : <FLREQ>"
    incoming tell :  "Name>><FLREQ>"

So sending a friend request made the addon read our own outgoing request as an incoming
one from the person we had just asked, creating a phantom pending entry. Fixed by
rejecting lines starting with `>>` and anchoring the incoming match to `Name>>`. This is
exactly the class of bug that only shows up in world.

### Verified with TWO real clients (the full test)

Two clients at 800x600 against local LandSandBoat, two separate accounts and characters
(`Test` on lsbtest, `Buddy` on lsbtest2), both in Southern San d'Oria and visible to each
other in game. Screenshots `friendlist-two-clients-test.png`,
`friendlist-two-clients-buddy.png`.

- `/befriend Buddy` on Test -> Buddy sees "Test would like to add you to their friend
  list. Use /friendlist accept Test or /friendlist decline Test." The tag never appears
  in either chat log.
- `/friendlist accept Test` on Buddy -> Buddy: "Test has been added to your friend
  list." Test: "Buddy has accepted your friend request." Both data files persisted
  (`test.txt` -> `friend Buddy`, `buddy.txt` -> `friend Test`).
- Presence ping/pong crossed both ways (`Test>> <FLPONG>` and `Buddy>> <FLPONG>`), and
  **both windows showed "1 friend, 1 online"** with the other player green.
- `/friendlist delete Buddy` on Test -> Test: "Buddy has been removed from your friend
  list." Buddy: "Test has removed you from their friend list." Both lists emptied.

That is the complete original feature — add, mutual consent, presence, remove — working
between two real players with no PlayOnline and no server-side support.

### Second bug found by two-client testing

Incoming tells arrive wrapped in colour/control bytes, so `"Name>><TAG>"` never matched
an anchored pattern — the request was delivered by the server but silently ignored by the
receiving addon. Fixed by stripping everything outside printable ASCII before matching.
Single-client testing could not have found this, because the self-tell path and the
outgoing echo both looked fine.

### Running two clients on 8 GB

Drop the resolution first: `[ffxi.registry]` `0001`/`0002` and `0037`/`0038` to 800x600
and `0003`/`0004` to 1024. Even then this machine sat at ~70-150 MB free with ~700 MB of
swap headroom, so close other apps first and watch `vm.swapusage`.

Each client needs its own command channel or they both eat the same file. `mousediag`
reads `cmd<FLCLIENT>.txt` and logs to `mousediag<FLCLIENT>.log`, so launching the second
client with `FLCLIENT=2` in the environment keeps them independent. Boot config for the
second account is `lsb2.ini`.

A second character was made by cloning the first in SQL. Note `chars` has a BEFORE INSERT
trigger that auto-creates the child rows (`char_equip`, `char_exp`, `char_jobs`, ...), so
insert into `chars` FIRST and only then copy `char_look` / `char_stats` / `char_skills` /
`char_jobs`. Pre-inserting the child rows makes the trigger collide with a confusing
"Duplicate entry for key PRIMARY" on a table that visibly has no such row.

## Why the NATIVE in-game menu cannot be populated (investigated 2026-08-17)

Daniel's goal was menu integration — making the game's own Friend List menu work, not an
overlay. Findings:

**The native menu renders fine on a private server.** Opening it shows "No friends
registered." rather than erroring, so the UI is intact and client-side. Only the data is
absent.

**There is no friend-list packet in the FFXI world protocol.** LandSandBoat implements the
protocol comprehensively and has `GP_CLI_COMMAND_BLACK_LIST` and
`GP_CLI_COMMAND_BLACK_EDIT` — the blacklist IS a world-protocol feature. There is no
friend equivalent. The one friend-named packet, `GP_CLI_COMMAND_FRIENDPASS` (0x01B), is
the *world pass* (inviting a friend to buy the game), unrelated to the friend list.

This is the crux: **no server can populate that menu through the game connection, because
the packet does not exist.** It is not that LandSandBoat failed to implement it. The
friend list is PlayOnline Viewer functionality delivered over PlayOnline's own channel.

**No client-side storage either.** `SquareEnix/FINAL FANTASY XI/USER/` holds macros and
per-character config; there is no friend-list file. The data is memory-only at runtime.

**Ashita offers no handle on it.** The SDK exposes IPlayer, IParty, IInventory, ITarget,
IRecast and friends — there is no menu interface and no friend structure, and no offsets
ship for one.

### What populating the native menu would actually require

Writing directly into the in-memory structure that `menu friend` reads. That is a static
reverse-engineering project against FFXiMain.dll, made harder than usual because **there
is no way to observe a populated state to diff against** — nothing can fill that menu
without PlayOnline, so the usual find-the-struct-by-comparison technique is unavailable.
It would mean disassembling the menu's draw/populate path.

Possible in principle. Not a code fix, and not a small job.

### What exists instead

The addon draws its own Friend List window. It is a genuinely working friend list — add,
mutual consent, presence, remove, all verified between two real clients — but it is an
overlay, not the native menu. Making it *look* like the native menu (FFXI frame art,
fonts, colours) is achievable and would satisfy "looks just like it"; making the built-in
menu itself light up is the reverse-engineering project above.

## 2026-08-17 — switched to Tanyrus/FFXIFriendList (server-backed)

Daniel chose to use **Tanyrus/FFXIFriendList** (GPL-3.0, Ashita v4 Lua, hosted backend
`api2.horizonfriendlist.com`) instead of our tell-based `friendlist` addon. Our addon is no
longer loaded from `scripts/default.txt` (backup `default.txt.bak-tanyrus`); the code stays
in `addons/friendlist/` for reference.

`addons/FFXIFriendList/` in this repo is upstream `main` (2026-06-12) plus three compat
patches, all needed on the Ashita 4.3 / imgui 1.9x that HorizonXI ships since 2026-08-02
(upstream issue #18 "Addon Crashing on Ashita 4.3" is open with no fix):

1. `FFXIFriendList.lua` — `imgui.BeginChild(id, size, bool)` → shim converts the boolean to
   the new `child_flags` int (was a sol "no matching function" Lua error).
2. `app/ui/FontManager.lua` — `M.get()` returns nil, so nothing pushes atlas fonts by index
   (`io.Fonts.Fonts[n]` is not valid under the new dynamic-font imgui).
3. `libs/icons.lua` — `M.GetIcon()` returns nil, so `imgui.Image/ImageButton` with the legacy
   signatures are never called; every icon falls back to text.
4. `FFXIFriendList.lua` — `jit.off()`. The remaining crash was
   `EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION` at `Addons.dll+0xA0761A`, which disassembles to LuaJIT's
   `lj_mcode_patch` walking a NULL MCode-area chain (`mov (%esi),%esi … mov 0x4(%esi),%ecx`
   then `VirtualProtect`). It fired on the first draw after load, roughly 3 times out of 4,
   and never after `jit.off()`. Note: when the Addons plugin catches that AV it can unload
   *every* addon (and once the plugin itself), which also kills the `mousediag` command
   channel — recover with `/load addons` typed by keyboard.

Verified live 2026-08-17 with two clients (Test / Buddy) on the local LandSandBoat server,
addon loaded per client as `FFXIFriendList` and a patched copy `FFXIFriendList2` (its
config dir renamed so the two clients get separate accounts/API keys):
`/befriend Buddy` → "Friend request sent" → `/fl accept Test` on Buddy → both lists show
the other with the green online marker (`tanyrus-friendlist-test.png`,
`tanyrus-friendlist-buddy.png`) → `/fl block Test` on Buddy removed the friendship on
Test's list live (`tanyrus-friendlist-after-block.png`) → `/fl unblock`, re-request,
`/fl deny Test` all echoed correctly. Quirk seen: `/fl unblock Test` printed
"test was not blocked" although `/fl blocked` had listed Test.

Caveats: the realm list on his backend is Horizon/Eden only, so a private-server character
registers under the Horizon realm on his hosted DB. Friend removal is UI-only (right-click
context menu) — there is no `/fl remove`. `scripts/twoclient.py` launches/drives client 1
or 2 (`launch N`, `cmd N "<chat cmd>"`, `shot N file`); mousediag's cmd channel now also
evaluates lines prefixed `LUA `.

### Update, same day — proper fixes, fork + upstream PR

The blunt "disable fonts / disable icons" patches above were replaced by version-aware
fixes (probe `imgui.ImageWithBg ~= nil` → ImGui >= 1.91): BeginChild shim, new
`Image`/`ImageButton` signatures in `libs/icons.lua`, and `jit.off()`. Icons and toolbar
now render correctly on Ashita 4.3. Fonts were left untouched (PushFont is pcall'd upstream
and did not crash once the JIT was off).

- Fork (what to submit to HorizonXI for addon approval): https://github.com/danielalanbates/FFXIFriendList — branch `ashita-4.3-compat`
- Upstream PR: https://github.com/Tanyrus/FFXIFriendList/pull/19 (fixes their #18)
- `addons/FFXIFriendList/` in this repo now mirrors that branch exactly.
- Our old tell-based addon is archived at `archive/friendlist-tell-addon-2026-08-17/`
  (and `addons-archive/friendlist` in the live prefix). `FFXIFriendList2` in the live prefix
  is only the two-client test copy (older blunt patches) — delete or resync before relying on it.

## GM Tools (SQLCommit/GMTools) — 2026-08-18

Installed `addons/gmtools` (MIT, v1.0.4, built for Ashita 4.3) for the local LSB server: `/gm`
opens an ImGui browser of 184 `!` commands (Teleport/Character/Skills/Items/Status/Mobs/World/
Quests/Admin/Reload/Debug), item search by name, favorites, presets, per-job gear loadouts.
Rendered first try; but the same LuaJIT fault as FFXIFriendList (`Addons.dll+0xA0761A`,
`lj_mcode_patch`) fired on `/gm gear WAR` and unloaded it. One line fixes it — `jit.off()` after
`require 'common'` in `gmtools.lua` (patched copy in this repo). Verified after the patch:
`/gm gear WAR` gave 18 items (inventory 7→24), `!setplayerlevel 75` via chat took effect
(char_stats.mlvl=75). Requires `chars.gmlevel` (Test/Buddy = 99). LSB prints "Lost key item: ."
after each `!additem` — server-side quirk, harmless.

**Pattern worth remembering:** on this Ashita 4.3 + Wine/Rosetta stack, *any* Lua addon that gets
hot enough to JIT can hit that fault; `jit.off()` at the top of the entry file is the fix.

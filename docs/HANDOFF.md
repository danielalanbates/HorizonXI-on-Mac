# Handoff — read this first

Updated 2026-08-14. **The 30 fps target is not met. In-world at 4K max is ~24 fps.** What *was*
found is where the time goes: FFXI blocks on a 16x16 render-target read-back four times a frame,
26 ms of a 40 ms frame, and that read-back decides whether entities render at all. Skipping it
doubles the frame rate and makes NPCs blink in and out; serving a cached copy instead makes them
vanish entirely. **Read `docs/MAX4K.md` first** -- it has the numbers, the two probes that found
it, the retraction, and the six dead ends.

The rest of this file is the 2026-08-11 rewrite, which replaced a wrong renderer-bound model
with a measured one. Its diagnosis still holds -- the renderer was never the limit -- and its
working practices are still current. Its fps figures are superseded by MAX4K.md.

## Daniel's goals and their honest status

> "Get to 30fps by any means necessary… When we find a solution, that is when we need to move to
> phase 2, open beta. We also need to bundle all the dependencies into a package for a less
> computer-literate user to download and try on their own. The launcher needs to have the
> standard login name and password section."

| goal | status |
| --- | --- |
| **30 fps in gameplay** | **NOT MET** — ~24 fps at 4K max. Cause located precisely, not yet fixed. `docs/MAX4K.md` |
| Understand *why* it is not 30 fps | **DONE, and it is not what we thought.** `docs/PERFORMANCE.md` |
| Fog / correct rendering | DONE (previous session), still correct |
| Launcher with login + password | DONE — Keychain-backed, `app/Sources/HorizonXILauncher/Credentials.swift` |
| Notarised installer | DONE (previous session) — `HorizonXI-on-Mac-2.2.dmg` |
| Bundle all dependencies | **UNBLOCKED this session** — the licence blocker was a misreading. `docs/BUNDLING.md` |

Standing constraints from Daniel: no changes that can cause visual glitches; launcher must start
the game in under 30 s; don't touch private-server code; use `/shutdown` in chat to log out,
never `kill -9` while a character is in the world.

## 1. The one paragraph that matters

FFXI on this stack is **not renderer-bound**. Draw calls cost 1.9 µs each and about 3% of a
frame; `Present` costs 0.05 ms; everything inside DXVK adds up to a fifth of the frame at
character select and almost nothing in the world. **Discarding every single draw call
(`DXVK_SKIP_DRAWS=1`) makes the frame rate go down, not up.** Optimising DXVK, MoltenVK, render
passes or draw batching cannot get to 30 fps, because they are not what the time is being spent
on.

In the world the client spends **~120 ms per frame doing nothing at all** — one stall per frame,
at 13% CPU. `docs/INWORLD-STALL.md` wrote it up as a bug report with eleven hypotheses
eliminated and put the strongest lead on FFXI's texture path through d3d8to9.

**It was found on 2026-08-14, and it was none of the eleven.** The client blocks inside `Map`,
waiting on the GPU to finish with a 16×16 render target it reads back four times a frame — a
lens-flare visibility test. It looked like a stall "outside every D3D entry point" because the
probes measured the *renderer* side; the waiting is on the D3D9 frontend, in
`WaitForResource`. `DXVK_STALL_LOG` measures it directly. See `docs/MAX4K.md`.

---

## 2. What this session actually produced

**Instrumentation, which is the durable part.** Frame rate no longer has to be read off an
overlay. Our `d3d9.dll` has six probes, all off unless their environment variable is set:

| variable | what it gives you |
| --- | --- |
| `DXVK_FPS_LOG` | CSV per second: fps, draws, render passes, barriers, submits per frame |
| `DXVK_PRESENT_PROBE` | ms inside `Present` vs ms outside it |
| `DXVK_DRAW_PROBE` | ms inside draws, ms inside state setters, every D3D9 call counted by kind, and a histogram of the gaps *between* our entry points attributed to the call that follows |
| `DXVK_PASS_PROBE` | which DxvkContext operation forced each render-pass break |
| `DXVK_FB_PROBE` | what changed about the framebuffer each time it was rebuilt |
| `DXVK_SKIP_DRAWS` | accept draws and discard them, to price the renderer out |
| `DXVK_STALL_LOG` | **ms per frame the client spends blocked** in `WaitForResource` / `SynchronizeCsThread`. The one that found the answer; cheap enough not to crash the client at 4K, unlike `DXVK_DRAW_PROBE` |
| `D3D9_LOCKIMAGE_PROBE` | every texture lock that stalls, aggregated by pool/usage/format/size |

Plus a harness that runs a whole configuration end-to-end from one command:
`scripts/harness/bench.py` (menus / character select) and `inworld.py` (logs a character in,
measures, logs out with `/shutdown`).

**Two real fixes.** `FFXI_FPS_DIVISOR=<n>` patches the client's frame-rate cap the way Ashita's
`fps` addon does — with it, a frame above 30 was recorded for the first time in this project
(33.6 fps). And `GetRasterStatus` no longer divides by a zero refresh rate.

**Five things closed with evidence** so nobody re-litigates them: draw batching, render-pass
churn, the Ashita overlay addons, FFXI's graphics settings, and the CrossOver licence blocker.

---

## 3. Corrections to what this project previously believed

- **"Batching draws gets us to 30 fps" (`BATCHING.md`)** — no. The 9.9× instancing ratio was
  real but it was solving the wrong problem. Draws are 3% of the frame.
- **"Disabling Ashita's 22 overlay addons is the most promising thing left"** — they never load.
  Ashita.dll is plugin interface **4.16**, every bundled plugin is **4.15**, so `PluginManager`
  rejects all of them including the `Addons` Lua host. Every measurement this project has ever
  taken was already addon-free. (Worth fixing for Daniel's actual gameplay: none of his addons
  work.)
- **"~11–29k draw calls/sec is a fixed ceiling"** — it is not a ceiling, it is a by-product.
  Frame time is a large fixed cost plus a small per-draw one.
- **"Bundling is blocked because the wrapper is CrossOver-derived"** — the wrapper's *engine* is
  `wine-10.0 (Sikarugir)`, LGPL, and the MoltenVK it loads is the stock Khronos build. The
  CrossOver leftovers (`moltenvkcx`, `wine.cx32bak`, `prefixcx24`, ~845 MB) are unused. See
  `docs/BUNDLING.md`.
- **"CPU 0% idle, so we are CPU-bound"** — in the world the process is at **13% of one core**.

## 4. Where to pick this up

1. **Make the read-back wait cheap instead of skipping it.** The 26 ms is spent waiting for a
   whole frame of queued GPU work to drain before the copy lands. Issue the copy at the top of
   the frame, or on a dedicated queue, so it has completed by the time the game locks it. That is
   exact rather than approximate, and it is the whole remaining gap to 45+ fps.
2. **Phase 2 packaging** on the `docs/BUNDLING.md` plan: first-run download of a pinned
   Sikarugir engine, our DLLs inside the app, game data from HorizonXI's own installer.
3. **The launcher's first-run Downloads prompt.** It still asks for access to the Downloads
   folder before the user has pressed anything, and three attempts did not find what is asking.
   For a package aimed at non-technical users this matters more than it sounds. See the comment
   on `Install.tccGatedNames`.
4. **Upstream the DXVK fixes** (`docs/UPSTREAM.md`). They are correct, small, and affect every
   D3D9 game on Metal. The read-back one is a semantic change and belongs upstream as an option,
   not as a default.

Do not promise 30 fps in beta notes. The honest line is: rendering is correct, the world runs at
~24 fps at 4K with every setting at maximum on an M1 with 8 GB, and the single thing standing
between that and roughly double is a read-back the game blocks on four times a frame.

---

## 5. Working practices that cost time to learn

- **Install `d3d9.dll` to all five paths** or you silently test the old build. Use
  `scripts/harness/install-d3d9.sh`.
- **`patches/dxvk-1.10.3-horizonxi.patch` is the whole thing** — apply it alone to a clean
  `v1.10.3` checkout. The three older patches are in `archive/2026-08-11/patches/` and will
  conflict.
- **Driving the game:** `CGEventPostToPid` does not work; the window needs real focus. Keystrokes
  do land even when `NSWorkspace.frontmostApplication` reports another app, so don't trust that
  as a gate — drive the scene by the measured draw count instead (`bench.py --heavy-draws`).
- **Never send blind Return presses in-world.** A previous session opened the auction house that
  way and reached a transaction-fee confirmation.
- **`/shutdown` sometimes needs a second attempt.** `inworld.py` retries; check `logged_out` in
  its result and log out by hand if it is false. A character left online is the one real risk in
  this harness.
- **Never rewrite `user.reg`/`system.reg` by parsing and re-emitting them.** It cost an hour
  here: the `DllOverrides` section stopped being readable, wine silently substituted its builtin
  d3d8, DXVK stopped loading, and the game still launched and rendered — so the only symptom was
  that every measurement came back empty. Check with `WINEDEBUG=+module`: a healthy prefix logs
  `get_load_order_value got standard key n for L"*d3d8"`, a broken one logs
  `get_load_order got hardcoded default`. Snapshot both hives first.
- **The character-select background is a valid oracle** — full textured landscape on a working
  build, black silhouette under a correct sky on a broken one. No login needed.
- Launch time is 30–31 s to window: ~14 s wine/Ashita, ~16 s FFXI+DXVK init.

# What to do next, and what not to bother with

Written 2026-08-14, for whoever — human or model — picks this up. `HANDOFF.md` is the long
orientation document; this is the short list of live leads, ranked, with the reasoning that
produced the ranking. Read [`MAX4K.md`](MAX4K.md) first: it has the measurements everything below
depends on.

## The state in one paragraph

Final Fantasy XI runs natively on Apple Silicon under Wine, correctly, at **~24 fps in the world
at 4K with every setting at maximum**. The goal is 30. The renderer is not the limit and has not
been for some time. The limit is that the client blocks ~26 ms of a ~40 ms frame inside `Map`,
waiting for a 16×16 render target it reads back four times a frame, and that read-back decides
whether entities are drawn. Everything else — the launcher, the branding, the addon rules, the
local LandSandBoat server — works.

## The one measurement to keep in mind

    fps    map_wait_ms  map_wait_n  map_blocked_ms  sync_cs_ms
    24.9   28.8         4.0         25.8            3.0

Turn it on with `DXVK_STALL_LOG=<path>`. If a change does not move `map_wait_ms`, it does not
move the frame rate, whatever else it does. Two separate sessions have now produced write-ups of
changes that turned out to affect nothing, so: **measure the mechanism, not just the fps.**

## Live leads, best first

### 1. Make the read-back not serialise the frame

Not *skip* it — that breaks the game, twice proven (`MAX4K.md`). Not *reschedule* it either; that
was tried on 2026-08-14 and three runs each way overlap completely.

What is left is changing what the wait waits *for*. The client blocks until the GPU has finished
the draws that produce that 16×16 surface. Those draws are a visibility test against scene
geometry that has already been submitted. Ideas, none tried:

- Find out what FFXI actually renders into that surface. If it is a handful of draws against
  already-resident geometry, they could be issued into their own command buffer at the *top* of
  the frame, before the scene, so the result is ready when asked for. `DXVK_PASS_PROBE` and a
  draw-call dump between the `SetRenderTarget` to that surface and the one away from it will say.
- Two frames of the result in flight, with the game reading frame N−1's *completed* result. This
  is not the same as the `ReadbackShadow` that failed: that served a stale-or-zero buffer with no
  guarantee it had ever been written. A proper double-buffer that only ever returns a fully
  written previous result may be visually acceptable, and unlike the shadow it can be checked —
  `blinkprobe.py` measures exactly this.

### 2. Ask whether 4K max is the right target for open beta

24 fps at 3840×2160 with everything maxed is a much harder ask than 30 fps at 1080p, and open
beta is for other people's Macs, most of which are not this 8 GB M1. Nobody has yet measured the
fps-vs-resolution curve on this stack. If 1440p max clears 30 comfortably, then "30 fps" as a
release gate is met for the configuration most testers will use, and the 4K number becomes a
known limitation rather than a blocker. This is cheap to measure and nobody has done it.

### 3. Verify the branding fix at true 4K fullscreen

`docs/BRANDING.md` records that the game draws the title texture with its left ~175 pixels off
the left of a 1440-px-wide window — HorizonXI's own logo was clipped by it too. The replacement
is nudged right to compensate. **Whether that clip exists at 4K fullscreen is untested**, and if
it does not, the nudge is now a misalignment. One screenshot answers it.

## Dead ends — do not spend time here again

Each of these was measured, not guessed. `MAX4K.md` has the numbers.

| tried | result |
| --- | --- |
| Skipping the read-back wait (`D3D9_RT_READBACK_NOWAIT`) | 2× fps, NPCs blink in and out. 17 of 39 frame pairs spike. |
| Serving a cached read-back (`ReadbackShadow`) | 53.8 fps, and the plaza is empty — every NPC gone. |
| Recording the copy early + flushing (`D3D9_RT_READBACK_EARLY`) | No effect distinguishable from noise, 3 runs each way. |
| MoltenVK command-buffer prefill | 22.30 vs 24.88 baseline. Worse. |
| Early buffer copies (`DXVK_EARLY_BUFFER_COPY`) | 21.84. Worse. |
| Eliminating render-pass spills | Costs frames. Symptom, not cause. |
| Disabling vsync | +0.6 fps. Noise. |
| Optimising the renderer at all | `DXVK_SKIP_DRAWS=1` — discarding *every* draw call — makes fps go *down*. |

## Traps that cost real time

- **Confirm the code path runs before believing a null result.** The 2026-08-14 early-read-back
  work benchmarked two builds whose new code never executed once; a per-object "has been locked
  before" flag was still 0 after 6,500 locks, because FFXI creates a fresh render target for each
  test. A flat frame rate and an optimisation that never ran look identical from outside.
- **Run-to-run spread is ~7 fps.** Single runs prove nothing. Three runs each way, minimum, and
  compare medians *and* ranges.
- **Kill leftovers between runs.** A crashed client leaves `winedbg --auto` sitting there and the
  next launch silently never renders; `wineserver -k` between runs fixes it. Two "failures" this
  session were only that.
- **Never `kill -9` a client that is in the world.** The session stays open server-side and the
  next login fails with FFXI-3201 for several minutes. Use `/shutdown` in chat — `inworld.py`
  does this already.
- **Modified is not relevant.** ~2,800 client DATs post-date the base install. That narrows a
  search; it does not identify anything on its own. An earlier session named four files as the
  title resources on that basis alone and they contain no images at all.

## Where things live

| what | where |
| --- | --- |
| Repo | `~/Games/hxi-workspace/repo-push`, branch `master`. **Internal SSD, not iCloud** — the iCloud copies are stale. |
| Harness | `~/Games/hxi-workspace/{bench,inworld,launch,drive_inworld}.py` |
| DXVK source | `~/Games/hxi-workspace/src/dxvk-1.10.3`, build with `ninja` in `build32` |
| Installing a built DLL | `./install-d3d9.sh <dll>` — it writes to five paths, and missing one silently tests the old build |
| The .app | `/Applications/FFXI-on-Mac.app`; prior versions archived to iCloud `Code/FFXI-on-Mac-archived/` |
| Local server | `./scripts/lsb-server.sh status` |

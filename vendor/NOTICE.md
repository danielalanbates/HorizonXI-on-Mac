# vendor — third-party binaries

Redistributed so `HXI_METAL=1 ./scripts/install.sh` works without a network round-trip. Both are
freely redistributable; neither is modified.

## x87sidecar_entitled

Patches Rosetta 2's x87 emulation with a native ARM64 JIT — FFXI's 32-bit client runs its
floating-point math through x87, which Rosetta emulates at roughly 1% of native speed (see
`docs/X87-WALL.md`); this is the fix, worth 11.3→28.5 fps in-world at max settings. Built from
source with one local patch, `../patches/x87sidecar-attach-pid.patch`, adding an `--attach <pid>`
mode: without it the sidecar can only patch a process it launches itself, but Ashita runs the
actual game in a child process (`horizon-loader.exe`) that a launch-time wrap never reaches.

Built with the `get-task-allow` and `com.apple.security.cs.debugger` entitlements
(`x87sidecar-entitlements.plist`) required to attach to another process at all. `bundle.sh`
re-signs it individually with that plist *after* the app's own deep-sign, which otherwise
overwrites it with the app's entitlements (none) and silently breaks attaching.

**Why these exact versions.** DXVK 2.x and 3.x require Vulkan 1.3 and the `geometryShader`
feature. Metal has no geometry shaders, so MoltenVK can never expose one and those releases can
never run on Apple Silicon — 3.0.2 loads, enumerates the M1, and rejects it. 1.10.3 predates that
requirement. Gcenx's macOS repack of 1.10.3 omits `d3d9.dll` entirely, so it has to come from
doitsujin's release.

## dxvk-1.10.3-x32-d3d9-nofog.dll

DXVK 1.10.3 (doitsujin/dxvk, zlib/libpng licence), built here from the v1.10.3 tag with two
patches in `../patches/`:

* `dxvk-1.10.3-build-gcc14.patch` — build fixes only. GCC 14 / mingw-w64 14 no longer include
  `<cstdint>` transitively, and mingw now defines `_D3DDEVINFO_RESOURCEMANAGER` itself, so DXVK's
  old workaround became a redefinition.
* `dxvk-1.10.3-ffp-fog.patch` — the functional change. Fixed-function fog is bypassed, because it
  reads `render_state_t`, the uniform block MoltenVK mis-binds on Metal. See docs/PATHWAYS.md.

Build: `meson setup --cross-file build-win32.txt --buildtype release builddir32 &&
ninja -C builddir32 src/d3d9/d3d9.dll`, then `i686-w64-mingw32-strip -s`.

The unpatched `dxvk-1.10.3-x32-d3d9.dll` is kept beside it for comparison.

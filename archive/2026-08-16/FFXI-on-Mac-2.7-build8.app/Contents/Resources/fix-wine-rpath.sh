# Fix the Sikarugir/Kegworks wrapper's dylib rpath on macOS.
#
# The bundled `wineserver` (and `wine`) are linked with an rpath of `@loader_path/../../`,
# which resolves to `<wrapper>.app/Contents/SharedSupport/`. The dylibs they need
# (libinotify, libgnutls, libfreetype, ...) actually ship in `Contents/Frameworks/`.
# The result is a hard `dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libinotify.0.dylib` at launch.
#
# The commonly suggested workaround — exporting DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH — is a trap on
# macOS: SIP strips every DYLD_* variable when exec'ing a protected binary, which includes
# `nohup` and `/bin/sh`. So the wrapper works interactively and breaks the instant it is
# backgrounded or driven from a shell script (winetricks is `#!/bin/sh`).
#
# Symlinking the frameworks into the directory the binaries actually search removes the
# dependency on any environment variable at all.
#
# Usage: ./fix-wine-rpath.sh /path/to/wrapper.app
